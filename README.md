# Calculator-in-ABAP


Z_CALCULATOR is an ABAP program that implements a basic calculator functionality. It accepts two input values, p_input1 and p_input2,
and provides options to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program features
a user-friendly selection screen with pushbuttons for each operation. Upon selection, the corresponding calculation is executed, 
and the result is displayed. The program includes error handling to prevent division by zero and displays appropriate messages. 
Users are prompted to provide both inputs before performing any operations. Z_CALCULATOR serves as a demonstration of ABAP programming
concepts, user interaction, and basic arithmetic calculations.
